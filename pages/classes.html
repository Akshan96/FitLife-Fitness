            <h3>Weights</h3>
            <p>Weights are any training load that isn't connected to another apparatus or piece of gym equipment. It's free, meaning you can pick it up, move it, and do whatever you want with it really. The only thing youâ€™re fighting is the force of gravity on that object.</p>
            <p>Weight training is a common type of strength training for developing the strength and size of skeletal muscles. It utilizes the force of gravity in the form of weighted bars, dumbbells or weight stacks in order to oppose the force generated by muscle through concentric or eccentric contraction. Weight training uses a variety of specialized equipment to target specific muscle groups and types of movement.
                Sports for which strength training is central are bodybuilding, weightlifting, powerlifting, strongman, highland games, hammer throw, shot put, discus throw, and javelin throw.</p>
